    "### Project: Sentiment Analysis and EDA for Amazon's Customers Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - I have performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Sentiment Analysis on the below datasets to understand the sentiments of the customers reviews which further required to understand customers experiences and how the Amazon's vendors/sellers performing! Based on the KPIs of the business teams, these analyses helps to know the quality of products and sellers performance in the Amazon's e-commerce platform.\n",
    "> - Sentiment analysis depends on their customers neutral or negative reviews. This helps to further investigate on products quality and improvise the sellers.\n",
    "> - WHY: To maintain the stability and growth of sales as they are directly proportional to the quality of the products and sellers of a business, this contrubutes to expanding sales w.r.t new and return customers.\n",
    "> - More non-positive reactions indicates that, those products/category needs attention to improvise on its quality checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - The open-source datasets I have chosen are available at: \n",
    "    - https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html\n",
    "    - https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html#code\n",
    "    - **Note**: These datasets available in category-wise with definition of each variables/columns.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> - **Nature of these datasets are available in compressed .json.gz format. So each products are available in category-wise with .json.gz format and I have converted three of the categories into individual .json files. Then I have merged .json files of all these selected three categories into **reviews_ori_data.json**. Then cleaned this dataset by skipping unwanted variables in each category and saved as 'software_products_cleaned.json', 'office_products_cleaned.json' and 'musical_instruments_cleaned.json' respectively**. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Steps performed:\n",
    "1. **EDA**: To understand the datasets and their structures along with what has happened from the available historical dataset i.e., Descriptive Data Analysis\n",
    "2. **Data cleaning** and extracted the data and generated DataFrames for further purpose i.e., Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "3. **Sentiment Analysis** to compute the average sentiment score of each product and each category\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: I have installed and imported modules as and when required at the time of writing the code:"

    "> - Knowing basic information such as number of records & variables, descriptive statistical values of numerical variables\n",
    "> - Confirm the right data types of each variables and format them if they are not rightly considered. Ex: date values can be treated as object (string) type in Pandas by default.\n",
    "> - Based on the scale/type of dataset, sub divide them into respective datasets. Ex: I have performed in this analysis by sub-setting the dataset into category-wise JSON files - that helps for the maintainability of the code, however each of the outputs can be merged/joined into single dataset and reports can be generated accordingly!\n",

    "**Sentiment Analysis (SA)**:\n",
    "> - Helped to understand the sentiment score for each review for each products and categories\n",
    "> - Bar graph shows the customers sentiment reactions for each products of specific category\n",
    "> - From the bar graph and computed 'average_sentiment_score' we can say that: \n",
    "    - product_ids B00004W62O, B00005MOTH, B00022PTRU and B000BQXTSS products need attention as they have negative sentiment scores. \n",
    "    - product_ids 0763855553 and B0002UCSKI are doing below average.\n",
    "    - product_ids with the average score of 50.00 and above are doing good.\n",
    "    - These are key findings can be found from the sentiment analysis to understand the products/sellers as they are key factors for the sales aspects of business\n",
    "> - SA helps know, how each product or seller performing to improve on the sales aspects of the e-commerce platform\n",
    "> - It further contributes to Amazon's business team to help maintain and increase the sales growth and their any future expansions w.r.t new and returning customers!\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Further to this, Amazon's products dataset can be mapped/merged with the dataset I have generated from this Sentiment Analysis to know the name of each product**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "> - The above execution steps are common to perform the sentiment analysis & EDA on other products-category reviews thus these can be further refactored into functions-based code-base and pass in other products category as argument into caller functions to get these reults.\n",
    "> - My this approach can be further optimized with the tools to accommodate large scale datasets as in .json.gz files.\n",
    "> - Possible next scope of my project: To build the Text Classifier model using Deep Learning algorithm to determine/predict the sentiment of texts from similar datasets and apply Predictive Data Analysis and/or Prescriptive Data Analysis"
