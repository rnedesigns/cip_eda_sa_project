    "### Project: Sentiment Analysis and EDA for Amazon's Customers Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - I have performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Sentiment Analysis on the below datasets to understand the sentiments of the customers reviews which further required to understand customers experiences and how the Amazon's vendors/sellers performing! Based on the KPIs of the business teams, these analyses helps to know the quality of products and sellers performance in the Amazon's e-commerce platform.\n",
    "> - Sentiment analysis depends on their customers neutral or negative reviews. This helps to further investigate on products quality and improvise the sellers.\n",
    "> - WHY: To maintain the stability and growth of sales as they are directly proportional to the quality of the products and sellers of a business, this contrubutes to expanding sales w.r.t new and return customers.\n",
    "> - More non-positive reactions indicates that, those products/category needs attention to improvise on its quality checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - The open-source datasets I have chosen are available at: \n",
    "    - https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html\n",
    "    - https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html#code\n",
    "    - **Note**: These datasets available in category-wise with definition of each variables/columns.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> - **Nature of these datasets are available in compressed .json.gz format. So each products are available in category-wise with .json.gz format and I have converted three of the categories into individual .json files. Then I have merged .json files of all these selected three categories into **reviews_ori_data.json**. Then cleaned this dataset by skipping unwanted variables in each category and saved as 'software_products_cleaned.json', 'office_products_cleaned.json' and 'musical_instruments_cleaned.json' respectively**. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Steps performed:\n",
    "1. **EDA**: To understand the datasets and their structures along with what has happened from the available historical dataset i.e., Descriptive Data Analysis\n",
    "2. **Data cleaning** and extracted the data and generated DataFrames for further purpose i.e., Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "3. **Sentiment Analysis** to compute the average sentiment score of each product and each category\n",
    "    \n",
    "> - **Possible scope of my project**: To build Text Classifier model using Deep Learning algorithm to predict the sentiments score of similar datasets and apply Predictive Data Analysis and/or Prescriptive Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: I have installed and imported modules as and when required at the time of writing the code:"

    "> - Below are the categories 'musical_instruments', 'software_products' and 'office_products' I have compiled into 'reviews_ori_data.json', I have further sub-divided them into individual json datasets due to the scale of the json.gz files and for better reusability & maintainability purpose.\n",

    "> - Based on the scale/type of dataset, sub divide them into respective datasets. Ex: I have performed in this analysis by sub-setting the dataset into category-wise JSON files - that helps for the maintainability of the code, however each of the outputs can be merged/joined into single dataset and reports can be generated accordingly!\n",

    "    - product_ids with the average score of 50.00 and above are doing good.\n",
    "    - These are key findings can be found from the sentiment analysis to understand the products/sellers as they are key factors for the sales aspects of business\n",
