I got everything I expected out of my order for a good price and the product shipped fast. This pedal works excellent with my old Yamaha electric keyboard!,B00005ML71,0.784
"I use this while gigging with my MOX6. Sturdy, built well, and works just like you'd expect. Gives me the full volume range with good micro-adjustment.",B00005ML71,0.7579
"I love it, I used this for my Yamaha ypt-230 and it works great, I would recommend it to anyone",B00005ML71,0.8957
"works s it should and it doesn't weigh too much. It could be smaller and a little cheaper, but no big deal.",B00005ML71,-0.3409
"This pedal appeared to be of very good quality. Unfortunately, it has an attached cord instead of allowing you to use your own 1/4"" cord. Plus, I need an right angle connection at the end which this does not have, so I had to return it unused. Would not recommend this if these things are important to you.",B00005ML71,0.0565
"Pedal is made real good Not like some of the other junk light weight Pedals I sent back., Con just a little But not a problem.. Love it. Would buy again,",B00005ML71,-0.6318
"This is a well made high quality pedal so have no doubts on the quality of construction. Yamaha is VERY good. Worked just fine as an expression pedal for my Zoom 505II. The only thing is that if you're using this with a Digitech processor, it won't work normally. You need a ""continuous control"" pedal for Digitech devices. Good luck!",B00005ML71,0.8433
Controls volume by default and works well. We purchased to set it up in the keyboard settings to change rotary speaker speed on organ setting. Works well but keyboard settings tricky... but this is the keyboard's fault and not the pedal.,B00005ML71,-0.3506
"works as adversited. use it in a live stage situation, price was right, bought one for the other keyboard player in the band too.",B00005ML71,0.0
It works well. No polarity switch - would not work with Casio. Keep swinging and playing music Fats Waller is the best!,B00005ML71,0.7345
Got this for my Yamaha EX5 in addition to the FC3 and FC7. I needed the whole set to setup different parameters and control to each. works great!,B00005ML71,0.6588
Got this guy and it works perfectly with my Yamaha EX5. Very sturdy in its construction. Great control/motion over the volume unlike other controllers that have a smaller range.,B00005ML71,0.8519
I was glad to have read other reviews that suggested we get this pedal right away for a kid who is used to having one on his piano. He uses it just fine. Really it would have been problematic not to have it!,B00005ML71,0.2942
"I have two of these. They are built like a tank, operate very smoothly. I like the Fortissimo feature (spring return). It is a very good value for the price. The only negative I would give it is big. I like the size of the Hammond pedal better, but that is just my preference.",B00005ML71,0.699
I bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard. It does just what I wanted it to do.,B00005ML71,0.0
"I actually purchased this to act as a foot pedal for a Yamaha Y-DD40. Helped me see just how bad my instrument skills were, however I highly recommend this product. I haven't tried any other foot pedal though. I will mention that it doesn't seem to have a sensitivity to it, just a single button press type.",B00005ML71,-0.1796
Built like a tank and does all it's suppose to do. Heavy construction which means it will last for years. I love my Yamaha products because there built with quality.,B00005ML71,0.7717
"I didn't read the reviews before buying this pedal and so I was unaware of the always-on vs always off issues that people are having with some keyboards. Luckily, the pedal works perfectly with my MIDI controller, which is an old Roland PC-180A.",B00005ML71,0.7522
I can understand why folks who are most familiar or most comfortable with a pedal that re-creates the feel of what can be found on a real piano might not be thrilled with this. But I just needed something to be able to get a sustain effect out of an old Yamaha DX21 keyboard. This product did the job and works great.,B00005ML71,0.8044
"This Fender cable is the perfect length for me! Sometimes I find it a bit too long but I don't mind. The build quality is great and I know that it will last. The only gripe I have with this cable is that the metal sleeve gets unscrewed way too easily, requiring me to tighten it often. Sound quality is not affected, and the color is cool, definitely try this cable out.",B000068NSX,0.9615
Fender cords look great and work just as well. By adding the word California to the description I'm sure to sound like the Beach Boys...,B000068NSX,0.875
wanted it just on looks alone...It is a nice looking cord... I know it will perform...as for Sam Ash ...this cord was packed in a mailer inside another box with my Roc n Soc... his shipping team do great work..never any complaints from me... I love Sam Ash.. thanks Amazon,B000068NSX,0.9186
Can't find any complaints at all.. Works and sounds as good as cables quite a bit more expensive... Great for that vintage strat sound...,B000068NSX,0.8603
"OK, I will say it, these cables just look cool in your rig. But beneath the flash you get a quality Fender product that is dependable and sturdy enough to take the punishment of life on the road. I use these between my guitar and effects and pedals to amp on send and return effects, no doubt of which cables are mine. Highly recommend.",B000068NSX,-0.6479
"This is a decent cable, the length and the quality are ok for the price, but the shielding is really pretty poor-- I played with this cable about 15ft from the board, and it was crossing over a few other cables, and there was lots of line noise.",B000068NSX,0.87
"Once again Fender doesn't disappoint. These cables are the best, they improve the sound of my guitar tremendously. It also eliminates some buzz I get when I hook up extra pedals. Great cables, can't do wrong with a Fender.",B000068NSX,0.9434
"This is a pretty nice cable. It's very cheap for the quality of signal it passes. The lining looks nice, but frays easily - more easily than other wrapped cables I've had. Because of the long, rigid plastic/rubber end of the cable, this is more suitable for an instrument with a front jack plate. It won't be usable for bottom-mount if you want to be able to sit down and play. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase.",B000068NTC,0.9606
its a cable. Its red. It works. looks great with a red guitar. even works fine for drum triggers. Nuff said.,B000068NSX,0.7096
Very good cable. Well made and it looks great with my Candy Apple Red Tele. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it tends not to lay flat on the floor.,B000068NSX,0.8643
Very nice guitar cables from CALIFORNIA CABLES! Bright red shows up on stage. No noise cables. Lifetime warranty. 18 feet long. They are made very well and should last for quite a while. Thanks guys! Get yours now at a great price. Get a couple for the musicians in your life for Christmas! HO! HO! HO!,B000068NSX,0.9396

Good accessory,B000068NTU,0.4404

Great for the buck,B000068NTU,0.6249
"This cable works like it should, is built with high quality components, and is priced very aggressively to boot. Can't top that combo.",B000068NVJ,-0.1742
"Not much to say ... great mic cable, decent thickness/gauge, haven't noticed any noise at all, it works. Never had any problem with Hosa stuff, which is why I chose this cable over others available in a 3' length. So, there you go!",B000068NVJ,0.7684
"These are missing the pin on the other side and keep falling out of the instrument. Not a very good wire for live use, maybe in the stufio where you will not be moving around with it.",B000068NTU,-0.6622
Works great!!!,B000068NTU,0.7163

"Cool does the job!,no problems",B000068NTU,-0.1759
Can't say it's amazing quality but what it is is very functional at a very low cost. More than what you're paying for but you won't mistake it for a $20 alternative. It functions just as well as expensive alternatives from what I can tell.,B000068NTU,0.0203

got it quickly. Cable works well,B000068NVJ,0.2732
Great product at a great price! I'd order again in a heartbeat!,B000068NVJ,0.8684
"I use this for live audio. I run it from my microphone to a vocal effects pedal so I needed a shorter length. I prefer the old-style silver switchcraft/Cannon style ends for their vintage look with my Shure 55H microphone. For recording, I'd go with a higher quality cable but this has been great in a live setting.",B000068NVJ,0.7684
"Horrible, stiff cables that are more or less locked in the position they came in. Other Hosa cables have more flex to them, which is what I was expecting here. Seriously, stiff cables are the worst.",B000068NTU,-0.8519

"I am using this Hosa XLR cable on a mic preamp to sound mixer setup. This distance needs to be kept short and this cable worked out just fine.

"Not much to say about a 5-foot MIDI cable except that I've always been a fan of Hosa's stuff - it's fairly priced, works for years, and won't leave you wanting for something more expensive. Fits perfectly into the 5-pin DIN jack on my Korg Volca Bass.",B000068NTU,0.7852

"Hosa products are a good bang for the buck. I haven't looked up the specifications, but I'm guessing the wire is 22 to 24 AWG, but since it's only 10' long, it's good enough.",B000068NVJ,0.7003
"Cable is thick, heavy, doesn't kink, and has a quality feel. Strain resistance seems like it should hold up well under medium duty use. The ends look like they open easily, so it can be made into a shorter cable should it ever fail. In my experience, most Hosa gear seems to be higher quality than the price would indicate.",B000068NVJ,0.5859
I have never had a problem with Hosa cables. I use them for everything in my home studio. Well made and I've never had one fail.,B000068NVJ,0.7358
