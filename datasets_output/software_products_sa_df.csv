0763855553,0.807,"This is really a great buy. It breaks down to a full MS Office software suite for 5 computers plus 1TB of online storage. The storage alone is worth the price. Well worth $100 per year, or less than $10 per month."
0763855553,0.2716,I have this running on my Macbook Air and two HP laptops. Set up took less than 3 minutes. It is a one year subscription which is totally fine with me considering it averages out to $20 per year.
0763855553,0.1265,"not that easy to understand or install, documentation should be better."
0763855553,0.6892,"Works well! Use for Outlook and Word, Excel!"
0763855553,-0.2892,"We got this for 2 Macs and 2 Windows machines. It works OK on both platforms. I use it mostly on a Mac, now. I don't like that almost every time I go to use it, there's yet another update to go through. It's really annoying. We've since gone with the monthly online version."
0763855553,0.6249,What can you say great product.
0763855553,0.4754,Has been very helpful.
0763855553,-0.5707,"Complete rubbish! I got this with an Acer aspire laptop and installed it. There is no shortcut and double clicking the file does nothing. All previous versions of Office have worked, but this is rubbish and the is no manual or proper instructions. Microsoft had gone way downhill.
If you can come up with any alternative, get that instead."
0763855553,0.5663,"I Bought This So I Could Get Full Use Of The Office iPad Apps. However I Also Did 2 Mac Installs, & 2 Windows Installs !! Was Completely Painless, & The KEY Code WAS Valid !!!"
0763855553,-0.8934,"When I try to install I receive error code 30088-04. Can't even find the error code.
Tried several times.
Have Windows 8 in a brand new HP computer.
Gave up. Life is too short.
Should have bought a Mac.
No wonder the CEO resigned. Poor Microsoft. Sinking ship ...."
0763855553,0.8268,Office 365 is less than $100 per year for 5 users. We purchased this and our kids use it on their Macs while my wife and I use it on our PC's. What did we do with the 5th license? Donated it to a friend who is a single mom and widow. It's really nice to have that flexibility.
0763855553,-0.0418,I really thought this was one of those programs I could get a lot of use out of. However I have used this program so very little that I cannot give a meaningful review to it. From what I've seen of it and had I really got into using itI can say that it's a top shelf program.
0763855553,0.9509,"I guess it all depends on your needs. The software is great, but this is essentially a rental program. You buy again next year for $100 (if you have need for software for 5 machines and you need the cloud, then it is pretty reasonable at $20 per machine.) I guess we are all looking for cost effective solutions, so this may work better for some than for others. Personally, I have resisted Adobe's efforts to put me into the rental group, I feel the same about this. But times they are a changing and sooner or later, we are all going to end up in a rental program."
0982697813,0.9602,"I've not had nearly enough to look at this all the way through. It would probably take years. But thus far I am very impressed. The content is rich and informative. It's fun to hunt down all the ""rabbit trails"" looking for new information. Very well done!"
1413313701,0.6155,"I just couldn't get to grips with this software. It's not bad, but I just thought that in this case, it would be easier just to eat the cost and pay an attorney to do this for you. Not for me, but might be for you."
1413313728,0.955,"The Quicken Legal Business Pro book and application is a terrific addition to my business software arsenal. Full of useful information, and a comprehensive collection of highly useable legal forms, its a great help in getting your paperwork in order and standardizing your forms. Highly recommended!"
1426296355,0.7345,"Received the order fast and it works on snow leppord! Installed on my MacBook pro in a matter of minutes. Packaging was like new. National geographic rocks and is faster than the new version since I have older hardware. Also, it comes with free updates. ."
1426296355,0.5327,"All the National Geographics together, and easily searched! I made the 'mistake' of buying direct from NG, but even with a discount it was more than on Amazon."
1600775411,0.5548,"Easy to use. I like that you can use it on your computer but also learn more by transferring lessons to your iPod and learning while on the go. I learned a little bit but it didn't completely hold my attention or make me feel immersed. Granted, I should have tried this more but nothing compelled me to keep coming back to it."
1600775411,0.9382,"This system is helpful for both beginners and advanced students. It is as good as other systems that cost you much more. I think that Spanish should be learned by any who wish to succeed in business in the coming years, and this system gives you a good start."
1600775411,0.8139,"This is a fairly typical learn by listening language system. It's not bad, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table. There are very few people who can successfully learn a language this way. Those who can will find it works just fine. It has the type of dialog you would expect. If you have tried other learn by listening programs you can expect the same results from this one."
1600775411,0.775,"I was thrilled to see Amazon present these, as I had wanted the Rosetta Stone version for years. Since I never used Rosetta stone, I can't compare, but I will say this was fun, but only for a few weeks. After the newness wears off, it didn't seem much different than the memorization needed by other types of language programs. Still, a very inexpensive way to try a language out."
B00004W62O,0.8481,This is a great extension to the Windows 98 line of operating systems. Unfortunately it is also the last in that line. The flexibility of having a modern operating system with Dos compatibility was a great idea so long as it was handled correctly.
B00004W62O,-0.7184,"I have this OS on an old laptop and it is truly madning. Crashes like there's no tommorw. Security holes the size of the ozone. Windows 95/98 were good but this is when the wheels came off, this was like a pre Vista it was that bad, thus far I would say ME and Vista are still the worst version of windows I have ever used, yes even worse than Windows 8 in terms of bugs/crashes."
B00004W62O,-0.1531,"I program computers, and we had number of compatibility problems with this OS. MS dropped much of good old DDE, causing number of shell application to crash, including number of uninstall programs."
B000050ZRE,0.6656,You can't go wrong with this device. It's the only hub I have that operates solely on power supplied by the PC. Plug it in and go. It's that easy to use.
B000050ZRE,0.6249,I thought this to be very inexpensive for all that we got. Great for the you boys for their computer center in our home school.
B000050ZRE,0.8803,"very good computer the intel Dual Core i3-2120 3.3GHz CPU, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 500GB HDD configuration is good enough for light use. The price is amazing"
B000050ZRE,0.9148,fantastic deal. very fast. great screen. solid laptop. really good.
B000050ZRE,0.2732,"Convertible

HArd drive space
Like everything"
B000050ZRE,0.6249,awesome fast
B000050ZRE,0.9465,"It covers screen barely on sides. Falls bit short on top n bottom too. It may look like large size guy wearing medium size pants. Display is amazingly sharp, stunning and beautiful. It catches No fingerprints. It doesn't create a glare either. Works perfectly in outdoor too. Giving 5 stars only due to size issue. I wish it would be bit larger on all edges. I haven't dropped my phone since applying this screen protector so can't speak for that part. Will see how it goes."
B000050ZRE,0.4404,thanks
B000050ZRE,0.5709,"I have been using this for over a month. It is very fast and starts up quickly, and screen is especially pleasing to the eye."
B000050ZRE,0.3612,Delivered on time and product was exactly as described. Would buy from this vendor again. Thank You
B000050ZRE,0.0,Estupendo
B000050ZRE,0.6486,Took a whole to get here but it works well and seems to be well constructed. Connected mine to a M2 bullet

B000050ZRE,0.6468,My Grandson is very happy with this laptop!
B000050ZRE,0.6249,Great find. Seller stellar. Need more.
B000050ZRE,0.6249,great
B000050ZRE,0.4098,"Unit came used, but in fine condition. Seems to be working well. I have not tried any advanced functionality as I just got a null-modem cable to get into that part."
B000050ZRE,0.5719,Excellent
B000050ZRE,0.7783,Great price from a company that also provides massive amounts of help for all your communication needs.
B000050ZRE,0.4404,"I have had this for years, it works great, no power sag."
B000050ZRE,-0.4153,This AP rocks!!! I miss you 3Com!!!!
B000050ZRE,0.8264,Love this! Good deal too!
B000050ZRE,0.2023,shelved the item when i found significant rf noise
B000050ZRE,0.0516,"It has worked for us reliably, and we don' have any complaint with its functioning. Besides, this switch offers a lightweight and reduced dimensions that allows to easily locate it in any place."
B000050ZRE,0.4927,very good after about four years
B000050ZRE,0.6249,Bought for son's Mac works great on my HP laptop

B000050ZRE,0.8519,NICE PRICE AND JUST LIKE THE ONE MY PHONE COMPANY WANTED $100.00 FOR AND IT WORKS FINE
B000050ZRE,0.6369,Work perfectly with my hackintosh
B000050ZRE,0.4404,Works nicely on a 10+ year old laptop.
B000050ZRE,0.5719,Excellent
B000050ZRE,0.6588,Worked great!
B000050ZRE,0.74,"I give it a 5 star because it did increase range.
Not significantly, but just enough to reach the distance I needed. Worth the ROI. IMO.
Soon I will replace the router and hopefully reuse these."
B000050ZRE,0.8987,"Super for home or business networks.
In addition to this eight port, I also have the 16 port that i run my office with. The design and mounting of these switches is great looking and functional. First switch to ever look cool. Power supply is built in so there is no power brick / wall wart.
Simple to mount. Simple to setup. And simple to manage with software (windows only)'or direct IP address of switch through any browser.
You will be impressed."
B000050ZRE,0.5719,EXCELLENT
B000050ZRE,0.6597,Perfect for my needs. I used this cable to extend from an amp to the antenna.
B000050ZRE,0.6588,Great!

B000050ZRE,0.4215,"nice product, recomended"
B000050ZRE,0.5423,Works well for PC's that are not equipped with Bluetooth. Plug & Play on Windows products.
B000050ZRE,0.6249,Older laptop with a dial up modem need the upgrade works great.
B000050ZRE,0.8652,Love them! Beautiful color!
B000050ZRE,-0.2942,the modem worked and stopped a rental fee each month!
B000050ZRE,0.6705,"21 Mbpbs with T-Mobile 3G, need to tape pin 20, and flash Thinkpad with non-whitelist bios. I also want to test it under MAC OSX, it has driver and software for MAC OSX from vender's web site Works perfectly under both Windows 2012 Server and Apple Mavericks 10.9.2"
B000050ZRE,0.9571,"Not too many users will have a need for a Power Over Ethernet Injector, but if you do...
The price to usefulness/quality ratio of this Poe is definitely worth it. I had it in use for a SOLID THREE YEARS without even a hiccup. I had a headset w/mic that I used for work, on a daily basis, and this item was a charm and one of the best small investments I made; Once connected I never gave it a second thought. The only reason it's not in use any longer is I no longer have the device I used it with. However, I know when I get another device that can utilize Poe, this little baby will come off the shelf.
I know this review is not timely at all, but I totally forgot about it until I saw it in my items to be reviewed list.
SMC has been around a long time, and if this particular model is no longer available, you can feel safe with any product manufactured by SMC
Two Thumbs Up!..."
B000050ZRE,0.7867,"This card is great for ESXi. If a person wanted to they can pass each individual port through to a different VM as this card uses a PLX PCI Express bridge to give dedicated PCIe lanes to each controller. There are two USB3 1042a controllers (Which may need to be downgraded to a lower level firmware as ESXi represents the PCI Device IDs incorrectly), and two Marvell storage controllers which I haven't messed with much."
B000050ZRE,0.7269,"perfect, product worked as stated, basically no set up, just open box and go. Looks well constructed. Would recommend product to others."
B000050ZRE,-0.3818,"Professional design for tablet, android, IOS
Inner 2000mAh Li-on battery, emergency power charge for your phone
Built-in 2000mAh Li-ion, lasting power supply. Complete charging for iphone And charging four hours for 3G hot spot."
B000050ZRE,0.5574,Thank you for a product well suited for small business requirement at a price that is beyond belief. This switch has been in opperation for more than 4 years and replaced previous model that was more than twice the price and lasted 2 years.
B000050ZRE,0.8342,This switch is perfect for desk use with its Classy Transparent design. It is a simple setup and I have never had a problem with the functionality of this switch.
B000050ZRE,-0.5574,My old one failed to work after continuously working for 4 years. Unfortunately the company behind this product can no longer be found. Luckily I found this one as a replacement.
B000050ZRE,0.9481,"Small, completely portable, inexpensive, and, best of all, WORKS GREAT and BETTER than expected! I'm using this in my RV to take advantage of the public WiFi. So glad I bought this & now I can watch streaming videos and music on YouTube, CNN.com, & other websites whereas before I could not get a strong enough signal."
B000050ZRE,0.7047,Bought this hotspot for a hotel guest wireless system and it did the job right. Antenna was a little weak but the features were great.
B000050ZRE,0.5017,"We've all read the technology blurbs - ""Fax is Dead"". This is not true. Many business offices -like real estate- still use fax. So what if one doesn't want a big machine sitting on the desk? This USB external device is a gem. Operation is simple and flawless"
B000050ZRE,0.8777,I am particularly pleased that this device comes with 2 sizes of bracket. It was easy to exchange the high-profile bracket for the low-profile one I need. The device is easy to install and performs well.
B000050ZRE,0.1779,Good product. Five stars means I had no issues with shipping or the product. It met my expectations and was as listed.
B000050ZRE,0.0,This product was researched by a co worker for an application we needed. I was looking for a place to purchase. This price was $20.00 less than any place I could find. The product worked as advertised.
B000050ZRE,0.6369,works and our AV guys love it people show up with laptops and need to connect plus you can have a secondary monitor as an output (we use it for PowerPoint)
B000050ZRE,0.9007,"It was amazingly easy to set up for a person like me who knows nearly nothing about computer networks. I was expecting a painful experience and a need to call customer support, but after responding to some simple questions from the ""Setup assistant"" on my Mac, I was suddenly told that it was all done! It works flawlessly ever since, never needing any attention. Just exactly what technology should be like. Thank you Apple!"
B000050ZRE,-0.4072,"Installed in 4 different computer workstations, all worked without issues. Highly recommend for all windows O/S systems, and the price is hard to beat."
B000050ZRE,0.6369,This brand is one of the best on the market I got this hooked up and running astonishing speed throughout my house in all rooms. Nothing beats this
B000050ZRE,0.4019,"I used this on one of my older laptops to sync my Bluetooth mouse and it works perfectly, the only thing I complain about is that it doesnt work with A2DP..."
B000050ZRE,0.5267,"There are a ton of digital media streaming devices out right now and a lot of them claim they work for digital signage. They don't. This one does. You plug it into an HDMI on any TV or monitor, log it into your Wi-Fi and then create an account on their wensite and you can immediately create any presentation you want. I have 3 coffee shops and this lets me create new content and post it toall of them at once with no software fee."
B000050ZRE,0.1027,"I have spent hundreds of dollars and dozens of hours messing around with digital media players trying to create a Digital Sign. Until I found the DSS media player it seemed like the only options were over $500, bulky and overkill, or $59 junk that just didn't do what I needed it to do and broke down heavy use. This media player just works. I can create and upload new images and RRS feeds to play in my store even when I am at home and it uploads instantly. The little thing runs 12 hours a day and has no problems."
B000050ZRE,0.6908,"I bought this gadget to be able to detect and avoid wifi, as wifi gives me headaches, nausea and heart disturbances. I carry this in my purse and it is an easy way to figure out what the strength of the wifi signals are. [...]
If this item is not available there are others like it on Amazon, do a search on WiFi detectors, or a RF field meter can be obtained, such as an Electrosmog Meter."
B000050ZRE,0.6779,"This is an old model, but I have two of them which were both purchased used. The first has been in service for several years now without a single complaint. I've found them to be much more stable than the consumer-grade products available at most retail outlets."
B000050ZRE,-0.4939,no problems. easy way to update my sony bravia that is 60 feet from my modem/router. i can even watch netflix with no issues.
B000050ZRE,0.8378,"Loved this thing, i went thru so many external 56k modems on my laptop with dial-up internet kept pulling the wires out of it. This thing solved everything. Highly recommended if you live in an area where your stuck to dial-up. And it might not be that bad if you have an office with multiple fax machines instead of buying a modem for each."
B000050ZRE,0.8434,"The install was easy, it comes with a disc and it's fairly good price for the item, These serial ports were standard on PCs in days gone by. Nobody really carries this item any more. I was glad to find it here."
B000050ZRE,0.5719,"I have used this to put all my papers, business cards,power cords and my Microsoft Surface. It is perfect for visiting clients."
B000050ZRE,0.9154,"I needed a Wireless N PCMCIA adapter for my older laptop. There are not many low price adapters on the market, so I went ahead and ordered this one. It works great! Easy to install. Excellent reception.
This product was delivered on time and was brand new when I received it."
B000050ZRE,0.6997,"I've had no issues with this hub. It does exactly what I needed it for, at a good price. I would highly recommend this to anyone needing to expand their USB port capacity."
B000050ZRE,0.4404,"As expected.
I've used lots of switches over the years and this one is every bit as good as the inexpensive ones from Micro-center."
B000050ZRE,0.5382,"This product is excelent, i receeived in justig time, all OK. In this case all is excelent. For what more words, you haave more time ???"
B000050ZRE,0.5562,I get free wifi from the library across the street and download bit torrents all day with this thing....great deal!
B000050ZRE,0.8221,"I stress-tested this product by purchasing 1,000 ft of CAT5e stranded UTP cable and connecting both ends using RJ-11 connectors and just one pair of copper conductor. Although the manufacturer recommends solid copper telephone wires, I thought I'd give it a shot anyways. The results were impressive. I got 50 Mbps on the other side and a SpeedTest.net test confirms the same internet speed I get when using my local Giganet LAN (i.e. around 30 Mbps). Highly recommended product, principally if you need to take a ride on an unused pair of telephone wires to extend a LAN. Bravo B&B."
B000050ZRE,0.875,pluged into my second pc ( other office ) presto internet. easy simple i love easy and simple. would recomend it to a freind
B000050ZRE,0.7964,"Geart deal, quick shipping and it works great. All you do is plug it into your PC and follow the instructions. Well worth the price and the shippng was fast"
B000050ZRE,-0.1941,I CAN FINALLY GET RID OF MY USB / STRAINER COMBO OUT OF MY WINDOW...THE SIGNALS I GOT BEFORE WERE 1/2 BARS ..NOW THOSE ARE 4/5 AND I HAVE NUMEROUS SIGNALS I NEVER RECEIVED BEFORE...HAVENT TRIED ANY DOWNLOADS YET BUT SO FAR THIS SET UP ROCKS...THANK YOU
B000050ZRE,0.4588,I was surprised that this product worked. The product is compatible with Dell's Optiplex 320. I have been using the product 24/7 and the product continues to work well.
B000050ZRE,0.2484,"Arrived quickly, was exactly as described, and seems very reliable. The driver uploaded very quickly. It works as described, and is very competitive price-wise."
B000050ZRE,0.8481,This product is an excellent - low cost for great product. We have used it many times on numerous jobs & recommend it highly.
B000050ZRE,0.7783,Using a MX846 to upgrade my Dell Vostro gave it new life. Download and install the driver from Dell before you install the chip. Super easy if you are not queasy about removing your keyboard.
B000050ZRE,0.8977,"Better than average, quite well as a matter of fact. Still running after 2 years. Good range also. XP users be advised to have at least Service Pack 2 (or 3 is recomended) installed to identify stations properly that use more than WEP encryption."
B000050ZRE,0.6324,this item is wonderful. it enabled me to install things permanently instead of having to disconnect and reconnect. i couldn't be happier. and it has the power to run things. i'm a computer illiterate but i know when my life is easier and less complicated.
B000050ZRE,-0.274,"This item came with WIDCOMM software.
After the installation, it worked very well.
I ordered several more, but it was no longer
available."
B000050ZRE,0.6597,These are great little switches I use them in the school district where I work and love them. No problems with them and I have been using them for over a year now.
B000050ZRE,0.836,All I can say is wow...had some trouble setting it up at first but with the Tech support and a little Microsoft fix...wala...this thing is amazing for the price.
B000050ZRE,0.7264,A very good inexpensive 24 port switch. The body of the switch actually takes up the entire width of the rack. This makes for a sturdy installation since the rack ears are very short. The switch is also better looking than the Netgear unit it replaced.
B000050ZRE,0.7902,A nice little flying saucer shaped USB hub a little over 3.5 inch in diameter also comes with an extra 56 inch USB cable works very well vista quickly loaded it nice product made in china .
B000050ZRE,0.7338,"If you don't like bells and whistles, this is great, plenty of room for all conponents. Very good price too."
B000050ZRE,0.6124,"I've used this modem since DSL came out, I still use it. It's built like a tank and probably fair to say that it's better than using a new dsl modem. Also, there is no router inside, which is good. There is no complicated settings, you merely hook this up to a router. There is no USB port. Simply hook this up to the wan port of a router. I have used this modem 24/7 for more years then I can count."
B000050ZRE,0.0,"I am using this antenna on a RV mounted on a pole and attached to my rear
ladder. I am now able to pick up wifi in rv parks with weak signals.
A good buy"
B000050ZRE,0.6124,"Easy to install, although one quick tech call to answer a question was required and was answered promptly. Small footprint, well made. Can't expect more for this kind of money."
B000050ZRE,-0.3274,"I got a new home computer and was transferring files from my work laptop using my old 10T hub. After over an hour, it was only one third of the way done. In frustration I bought this Asante switch. Once I hooked up the Asante, the whole thing copied in 12 minutes! At first I didn't believe it had actually copied everything. But it was all there, just 25 times faster. I should have got a faster switch years ago."
B000050ZRE,0.8658,"It's been working like a charm for the last 5 years, non-stop.
I just wish Snapgear cared about its customers and updated the linux kernels for these devices."
B000050ZRE,0.9184,"This switch was purchased for use as our primary gigabit LAN switch fabric, and it has worked as advertised out of the box. Since the model we purchased has been discontinued by 3Com, it's made it a great bargain from a price standpoint for a 48-port gigabit switch, as you can still find some new units. The web-based configuration management interface is well thought-out and easy to navigate. In our testing, we have found that the switch provides the LAN performance that we were looking for, so we are very satisfied with the purchase."
B000050ZRE,0.9536,"Asant is the best. We love their products, just wished they made a 12-port unit in this family. We're in a mixed environment (2 Windoze, 10 Macs, printers and NAS's) and the flow in our units are extremely stable and high-speed. We've done throughput tests and they're pretty much up there at maximum. We have 3 lines in Cat-5e and the rest are Cat-6. The runs are between 3m/12ft and 25m 85ft. We have 4 Asants and would continue to have more. They truly are hassle-free."
B000050ZRE,0.7629,"First one I ever bought, so far so good. Seems to work well and installation was easy, except that the installation instructions were difficult to follow. I called my cable company and they helped me figure out what to do."
B000050ZRE,0.749,"This is the perfect switch for someone looking for an affordable managed switch, quite and robust."
B000050ZRE,0.9289,This modem is just GREAT! I still use dial-up and this more than fits the bill (much faster than my old modem). It was very easy to install on my new home built computer that uses Vista Home Premium. I have been using it for about a month now and have had no problems. Thank You Amazon.com for the great service you gave me and I will definitely be using you again for future purchases.
B000050ZRE,0.5548,"This wi fi gaming access point was so easy to set up. My Wii, DS and PSP connected to it with no problem. It only takes a few minutes to set up.
If only, everything can be this easy."
B000050ZRE,0.875,"These things are bullet proof and blow the Cisco LinkSys gear out of the water. If you need the ability for two separate networks to talk to each other (VLANS), This is the switch for you. If all you need is a simple GigE switch, check out the ProCurve 1400-8 G switch. The ProCurves are build smarter and do not overheat. I've burnt through several Linksys Cisco and Dlink switches. These guys serriosuly need to advertise better. I would have saved 100's if I just purchased a ProCurve to begin with."
B000050ZRE,0.9299,"This is a great USB hub, it works perfectly! I love the blue illumination, so you can see that it's working with a quick glance."
B000050ZRE,0.8104,"I don't have this exact model, I have Zoom's Model #3048, which is nearly identical. I've had it for just over five months, (got it at Staples), and it's a terrific modem. Very reliable and stable. If you're in the market for an external modem, I highly recommend this one."
B000050ZRE,0.8807,Arrived in several days and worked perfectly in my old Windows 2000 notebook. Terrific product. Thanks.
B000050ZRE,0.6114,"I bought this video splitter for a work tradeshow - it was excellent! Plug in all your sources, push the power button to ON, and you're done. If only the rest of the electronics were that easy..."
B000050ZRE,0.6886,Far as I can tell the unit works just fine. I have it connecting my home office and residential network and works as intended. Didn't want to spend the money for the managed switch as I don't need it yet so for the price it works great.
B000050ZRE,0.6124,I needed to be able to switch a single computer between two completely different networks and I wanted it to be a physical switch so only one cable was actually connected to the computer at a time. This product did the trick perfectly.
B000050ZRE,0.7506,"If you can find it, buy it. Gigabit speed is outstanding.
Plug and play."
B000050ZRE,0.6784,"Not much you can say about this hub - it does what its supposed to! I have a lot of FireWire devices, most of which have two ports - but its nice central location to plug them into instead of daisychaining! I don't have to keep the devices next to each other anymore!"
B000050ZRE,-0.816,"What's not to love about a plug-n-play little hockey puck which solves so many of my connectivity problems. My Mac G4 MDD is notorious for having too few USB and Firewire connections, and a power supply which is a bit week for daisy chained devices. This powered hub solved my problems and it was a simple as, open the box, hook it up, turn it on, and start using it."
B000050ZRE,0.0,After a long search I was finally able to locate this modem that is not only a fax and data modem but also a voice modem. Voice modem is essential for answering machine type software on my computer. The product is working as expected.
B000050ZRE,0.8451,"A great little hub for those of us still wired to each other, very fast, no set up issues, just plug it in and it works, with auto speed sensing and nice activity display lights. Perfect for a wired home or small office network."
B000050ZRE,0.8622,"Item shipped quickly and arrived well packed. Extremely easy to set up and use. Good software & instructions. Robust & speedy network, far faster than my WAN. Has worked on every outlet I've tried so far in my 100 year old house, even through an extension cord."
B000050ZRE,0.9136,"So far this matrix switch has been working great for us in a conference room environment. Although we haven't really put this device through it's paces (testing video resolutions, noise levels, audio, etc.), this item has worked exactly how I had hoped right out of the box. The only area that I could see improved on this unit would be the addition of a remote control. Otherwise, great product with no issues so far."
B000050ZRE,0.0,"As with all Sonnet products I've used, this one works without a flaw.
Just installed it and started using it.
Sonnet really knows how to make products for the Mac."
B000050ZRE,0.7713,Bought 3 wireless routers/APs. This one works the best. Very stable connection. I have about 15 PCs connected to it.
B00005MOTH,-0.2177,"A little slower, a little more buggy and unstable, I'm surprised it's still sold when newer versions of the operating system are available."

B0001FS9NE,0.9465,"It covers screen barely on sides. Falls bit short on top n bottom too. It may look like large size guy wearing medium size pants. Display is amazingly sharp, stunning and beautiful. It catches No fingerprints. It doesn't create a glare either. Works perfectly in outdoor too. Giving 5 stars only due to size issue. I wish it would be bit larger on all edges. I haven't dropped my phone since applying this screen protector so can't speak for that part. Will see how it goes."

B0001FS9NE,0.5719,Excellent
B0001FS9NE,0.6588,Worked great!
B0001FS9NE,0.74,"I give it a 5 star because it did increase range.
Not significantly, but just enough to reach the distance I needed. Worth the ROI. IMO.
Soon I will replace the router and hopefully reuse these."
B0001FS9NE,0.8987,"Super for home or business networks.
In addition to this eight port, I also have the 16 port that i run my office with. The design and mounting of these switches is great looking and functional. First switch to ever look cool. Power supply is built in so there is no power brick / wall wart.
Simple to mount. Simple to setup. And simple to manage with software (windows only)'or direct IP address of switch through any browser.
You will be impressed."
B0001FS9NE,0.5719,EXCELLENT
B0001FS9NE,0.6597,Perfect for my needs. I used this cable to extend from an amp to the antenna.

B0001FS9NE,0.5574,Thank you for a product well suited for small business requirement at a price that is beyond belief. This switch has been in opperation for more than 4 years and replaced previous model that was more than twice the price and lasted 2 years.
B0001FS9NE,0.8342,This switch is perfect for desk use with its Classy Transparent design. It is a simple setup and I have never had a problem with the functionality of this switch.
B0001FS9NE,-0.5574,My old one failed to work after continuously working for 4 years. Unfortunately the company behind this product can no longer be found. Luckily I found this one as a replacement.
B0001FS9NE,0.9481,"Small, completely portable, inexpensive, and, best of all, WORKS GREAT and BETTER than expected! I'm using this in my RV to take advantage of the public WiFi. So glad I bought this & now I can watch streaming videos and music on YouTube, CNN.com, & other websites whereas before I could not get a strong enough signal."
B0001FS9NE,0.7047,Bought this hotspot for a hotel guest wireless system and it did the job right. Antenna was a little weak but the features were great.
B0001FS9NE,0.5017,"We've all read the technology blurbs - ""Fax is Dead"". This is not true. Many business offices -like real estate- still use fax. So what if one doesn't want a big machine sitting on the desk? This USB external device is a gem. Operation is simple and flawless"
B0001FS9NE,0.8777,I am particularly pleased that this device comes with 2 sizes of bracket. It was easy to exchange the high-profile bracket for the low-profile one I need. The device is easy to install and performs well.
B0001FS9NE,0.1779,Good product. Five stars means I had no issues with shipping or the product. It met my expectations and was as listed.
B0001FS9NE,0.7964,"Geart deal, quick shipping and it works great. All you do is plug it into your PC and follow the instructions. Well worth the price and the shippng was fast"

B0001FS9NE,0.4588,I was surprised that this product worked. The product is compatible with Dell's Optiplex 320. I have been using the product 24/7 and the product continues to work well.
B0001FS9NE,0.2484,"Arrived quickly, was exactly as described, and seems very reliable. The driver uploaded very quickly. It works as described, and is very competitive price-wise."
B0001FS9NE,0.8481,This product is an excellent - low cost for great product. We have used it many times on numerous jobs & recommend it highly.
B0001FS9NE,0.7783,Using a MX846 to upgrade my Dell Vostro gave it new life. Download and install the driver from Dell before you install the chip. Super easy if you are not queasy about removing your keyboard.
B0001FS9NE,0.8977,"Better than average, quite well as a matter of fact. Still running after 2 years. Good range also. XP users be advised to have at least Service Pack 2 (or 3 is recomended) installed to identify stations properly that use more than WEP encryption."
B0001FS9NE,0.6324,this item is wonderful. it enabled me to install things permanently instead of having to disconnect and reconnect. i couldn't be happier. and it has the power to run things. i'm a computer illiterate but i know when my life is easier and less complicated.
B0001FS9NE,-0.274,"This item came with WIDCOMM software.
After the installation, it worked very well.
I ordered several more, but it was no longer
available."
B0001FS9NE,0.6597,These are great little switches I use them in the school district where I work and love them. No problems with them and I have been using them for over a year now.
B0001FS9NE,0.836,All I can say is wow...had some trouble setting it up at first but with the Tech support and a little Microsoft fix...wala...this thing is amazing for the price.
B0001FS9NE,0.5093,"Simple to set up, faultless performance, slightly big and could be smaller. Price was right. Overall a 95% in my book!"
B0001FS9NE,0.7264,A very good inexpensive 24 port switch. The body of the switch actually takes up the entire width of the rack. This makes for a sturdy installation since the rack ears are very short. The switch is also better looking than the Netgear unit it replaced.
B0001FS9NE,0.7902,A nice little flying saucer shaped USB hub a little over 3.5 inch in diameter also comes with an extra 56 inch USB cable works very well vista quickly loaded it nice product made in china .
B0001FS9NE,0.7338,"If you don't like bells and whistles, this is great, plenty of room for all conponents. Very good price too."
B0001FS9NE,0.0,"I am using this antenna on a RV mounted on a pole and attached to my rear
ladder. I am now able to pick up wifi in rv parks with weak signals.
A good buy"
B0001FS9NE,0.6124,"Easy to install, although one quick tech call to answer a question was required and was answered promptly. Small footprint, well made. Can't expect more for this kind of money."
B0001FS9NE,-0.3274,"I got a new home computer and was transferring files from my work laptop using my old 10T hub. After over an hour, it was only one third of the way done. In frustration I bought this Asante switch. Once I hooked up the Asante, the whole thing copied in 12 minutes! At first I didn't believe it had actually copied everything. But it was all there, just 25 times faster. I should have got a faster switch years ago."
B0001FS9NE,0.8658,"It's been working like a charm for the last 5 years, non-stop.
I just wish Snapgear cared about its customers and updated the linux kernels for these devices."
B0001FS9NE,0.7629,"First one I ever bought, so far so good. Seems to work well and installation was easy, except that the installation instructions were difficult to follow. I called my cable company and they helped me figure out what to do."

B0001FS9NE,0.919,"Easy to install on XP machine, drivers worked great. Loaded quickly and easily, and worked! What else could you ask for?"
B0001FS9NE,0.7264,This was exactly what I needed. The Company provided good communication in regards to receiving my order and shipping information. Very pleased
B0001FS9NE,0.875,"I did my research on this product and found it to be exactly what I was looking for. I have run out of space for additional cards on my system and this card combines USB 2.0, Firewire, and RJ45 onto one card. Great card and Amazon had the best price that I could find online."
B0001FS9NE,0.9118,"This little USB/Firewire Hub is tops. Lots of ports, and it works like a charm. This is one great product for the price."
B0001FS9NE,0.4404,One of few that have 8 ports. It was a great price. It worked right away and got our system up in running in no time.
B0001FS9NE,0.9118,"I bought this mouse about a year ago, it's been great. I love that I can charge it, I cannot tell you how frustrated I've been with other wireless mice when the battery dies. It's cute, small, perfect to use when I travel or work from home without my docking station."
B0001FS9NE,0.7845,"The built in cable is just the right size. The hub works like a charm. After fussing with a USB 1.0 hub for a few months, this 2.0 hub is definitely a plus for any travel bag."
B0001FS9NE,0.2023,"Have it plugged into my wan/router so people visiting can use both WiFi or Bluetooth.. Especially handy since some of my customers have PDA's that only have Bluetooth built in. Also have several GigaBytes of MP3's for download, and those work fine on both the PDA's and phones."
B0001FS9NE,0.8872,"This router is great. The setup and installation was very easy. I've tried other routers, but this is by far the best."
B0001FS9NE,0.8669,"If you ship VHS tapes, you must get these mailers. They make shipping so secure and easy. The only way to fly for those who sell VHS through an online store. They have made my life as a seller so easy!"
B0001FS9NE,0.4692,"Plugged it in. Set it up the same as my previously failed SMC Barricade Router. Haven't had any trouble. I have not used the VPN feature. Have not used many other features, just an 8-port broadband router. Works great."
B0001FS9NE,0.9678,I like it !! It has nice features like web administration and it works pretty well. Great Product for an awesome price.
B0001FS9NE,0.0,"Smallest 4 port hub that I could find. I use it to recharge power on my road warrier devices (cell phone, mp3 player, camera, etc) from my laptop... using USB cables/plugs from boxwave."
B0001FS9NE,0.4964,"It works, what else can I say? I purchased it as a replacement for an older DSL modem in the hopes that it would do a better job of maintaining my connection to the Internet. There were no installation problems (I use it in connection with a router) and it does appear to be slightly more robust."
B0001FS9NE,0.7184,Installation under Linux is a snap I am the proud owner of te modem now for 2 months And I hope it will be my modem for years to come
B0001FS9NE,0.6656,You can't go wrong with this device. It's the only hub I have that operates solely on power supplied by the PC. Plug it in and go. It's that easy to use.

B000AOGDM0,0.9341,"We have used this numerous times and it works like a charm. I am using an Intel Mac and it works great if you have boot camp and windows XP. The program takes a little getting use too. I suppose I have been spoiled with ease of most Mac stuff. However, once you get use to using it and find where everything is, it becomes a handy tool when in unfamilar territory."
B000B5NS2G,0.2477,Norton Internet Security 2006 [Old Version - The Amazon reviews for this product listed that it considerably slowed down their computer operating systems. They were right. I would not recommend buying this version.
B000B5NS2G,-0.2263,Every year the installation of this software turns into a major hassle. The software doesn't properly uninstall the prior version and I have a mess on my hands. Every year. When is Symantec going to wake up? When am I going to wise up and buy some other company's product. This is ridiculous really.
