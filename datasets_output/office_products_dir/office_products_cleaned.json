Although we haven't tried most of the suggestions, we did flip through it and it's a great book.

This is a great companion to a microscope gift!",

I was expecting this to last us much more than one month.\n\nUpdate: I was able to fix the problem by removing the battery and then inserting it again. But still, this shouldn't have issues so soon with so little use of only once per day.\n\nUpdate ( a bunch of time later) We haven't had any more problems.

The main idea: You will be effective and sucessful if you develop procedures for your classroom. Tell the students what you want them to do and then model for them how to do it.

After trying the Derwent colored pencils I am hooked again to buy the full set of these as well. They lay so nicely in my hand and there is something special about them. Every good quality pencil has a different feel and slightly different color/hue imo. The coloring book has a southwestern feel about it and the equity of the paper is superb. It comes with some fine introduction into layering, blending etc.which is useful for new colorists. A very nice book to get you started in the coloring book craze; to see if it might be a new hobby for you. Highly recommended!!!",

Colored pencils would probably be ideal but I like using gel pens. I will probably go through my ink pretty quickly however. On a side note, the paper is thick enough that I can use gel ink and it doesnt ruin the pictures on the other side. I do find that these help my stress. I have a condition that aggravates my heart when Im stressed that is very noticeable. But if I take time to color in these I've noticed my symptoms have gone and I feel much more calm.
