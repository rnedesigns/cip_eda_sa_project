"I bought this for my daughter (7) to go along with her new microscope and slide set. Although we haven't tried most of the suggestions, we did flip through it and it's a great book. It gives enough detail to be valuable for years to come but not so much detail to be overwhelming to a child. I would think this book will last her until at least age 12. This is a great companion to a microscope gift!",079451524X,0.937
Well written!,079451524X,0.3382

"I'm a biology professor, and I teach microscopy. There are experiments in this book that I didn't even know about. My nephew and I are gonna have soooo much fun. I can't wait to share this with him and work with his new microscope. This is waaaay better than buying kids pointless games. Learning is food for the brain and it's better to start them while they're young.",079451524X,0.8027

"I really like this resource. I teach fourth-graders. This book helps the students learn to find specific information from a passage to support their thinking. It has several sections that focus on different skills: inference, main idea, cause and effect, etc. Another good thing about this book is that it gives the reading level of each passage, ranging from levels 2-4. The passages are also interesting. Some are excerpts from well-known childrens' books.",0894557696,0.9134

"A publication packed with useful information that is easy to understand. A must for any traveler heading to the last land frontier in the United States. Besides superior and information packed maps, the Alaska Atlas & Gazetteer provides readers with amazing insight into the culture, the settlement, the exploration and the little known facts that help readers develop an overall understanding of the state. The publication provides a remarkable insight into the Native-American population. Finally it provides pointers on where to go. I used this publication to plan my entire first visit. I love information on paper. The maps alone are worth hundreds of dollars.",0899332897,0.9803

"I bought these for my daughters! one daughter loved it (8 yrs old), one not so much (10 yrs old). It happened to fall on he ground and now it does not work. Don't get me wrong it should not be hitting the ground at all, but with children that just tends to happen. Also if you don't hit the two buttons at the exact same time it does not ""reset"" too easily. The plastic part is just that, PLASTIC and hard. It is not flexible at all.",0976142503,0.1695

High quality item. I liked it but don't get it for a 13-year-old. I thought she could use it for timing her French horn practice sessions or how long she's reading or doing homework. She didn't see it that way and I haven't seen this since Christmas. So. I think good for a younger child but I messed up on getting it for her. The packaging also refers to younger children which didn't help.,0976142503,0.0466

"I bought this from Barnes and Noble. It lasted about a month and now the option where you count up minutes won't reset anymore. The other option still resets so the buttons for resetting still work. Very disappointing. It has only been used once a day and has not been dropped or damaged to stop working like that. I was expecting this to last us much more than one month. Update: I was able to fix the problem by removing the battery and then inserting it again. But still, this shouldn't have issues so soon with so little use of only once per day. Update ( a bunch of time later) We haven't had any more problems. Now the only problem with this timer is that it likes to hide. But when we do find it, it works great. :)",0976142503,0.4337
My daughter has had this product for 10 months now. She uses it daily for her homework and used it very regularly over the summer as well. Does a very nice job. Haven't yet had to replace the battery. And it helps her be more independent with her homework. Pleased with the product.,0976142503,0.8655
"This CD set by Harry and Rosemary Wong is great for the veteran teacher as well as the teacher fresh out of college. The ideas are so simple yet they are so complexed in their delivery and results. Coupled with the classic ""The First Days of School"", this CD is worth the money and then some. The main idea: You will be effective and sucessful if you develop procedures for your classroom. Tell the students what you want them to do and then model for them how to do it. Ordering this CD allows you to listen to the lecture anytime anywhere:at home, in your car, at work. I highly recommend this for any teacher regardless of years of experience.",0976423324,0.9392

I have to manually cut out the teacher's copy. The teacher laughed and said, ""that's what happens when you try to go cheap."" Revised Review: Whoops! It didn't know that there were actually too versions of the item. I should have ordered the one with the copy perforated for pullout.

"I bought these for an RCIA class using the catechism prepared following the second Vatican ecmenical council. These tabs apparently match back to an older edition, with page numbers to match. I was still able to use most of them, by finding the page references myself but they are not a perfect match. The tabs themselves are good quality and application was fairly easy, but I might recommend finding an updated set if you plan to use the current catechism, unless you want to spend a lot of time searching and guessing which goes where.",0980006619,0.834

"AWESOME! A MUST HAVE! MAKES UNDERSTANDING AND STUDY EASIER! These tabs are almost IMPOSSIBLE to find elsewhere. These are excellent! Sturdy and well made!

I HIGHLY recommend them for new comers to the Catholic faith and anyone trying to read and understand the Catechism! MANY MANY THANKS!!!",0980006619,0.9871
"These tabs are 'made for' the USCCB edition of the Catechism - unfortunately (and oddly - as other USCCB publications are) not available through Amazon (but which can be found at any Catholic bookstore - brick and mortar or online).

I really like using jojoba oil especially when I do my at-home chemical peels, it is the perfect product to soothe my skin afterwards. As far as this particular brand, I would rate them in the top 3 that I have tried. the absorption rate is terrific and it is an added plus that it is certified organic! That is especially good for those who make creams, butters, oils etc... For the price, you are getting a healthy amount of oil too. I would recommend this product easily. Instanatural provided this oil for my review and feedback.",0989492362,0.9719
"I have very thick, coarse, curly hair. I have tried every product under the sun to keep the frizz at bay. I really like this jojoba oil. I have used Argan oil for months; I switched to give the jojoba oil a try. It works just as well, if not better. When I first get out of the shower I put a dropper full around my head, close the scalp, and around the ends. I comb it through and style as usual. It definitely keeps my curls more defined and keeps the frizz away. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product in my home. Would I recommend it? Absolutely. Great for curls.",0989492362,0.931
These were great. I did not have to cut them or do anything. I just stuck the on.....I did buy some eyelash glue just in case but did not need them. I put mine back in the box and will use again....,0989492362,0.3521

I was very impressed with the high grade of cardstock used to make these cards and the envelopes were quality made as well, they had a peel off tab to seal them shut. They also came with a Thank You card from the company giving me a discount on future orders. Personally, I think they are pretty plain, but sometimes there is a need for a very plain card.

Having survived a particularly long and adverse illness, I now find a new appreciation of my life as a result of unexpected survival. This calls for some serious journaling and my husband found THE perfect vessel in which to write my story - this magnificent leather record; rich, fragrant leather bursting with the most luxurious almost cloth-like paper that absorbs my fountain pen thoughts like butter on a hot biscuit. I truly believe you will LOVE it as much as I do. I highly recommend this journal, and may need a second one before I am done!",0991557581,0.9802

"At first i worried if the strap can keep the cover tightly around the notebook, but it's certainly not a problem cause the friction is good enough to hold it. The size is small and pages are thick as I wanted. The pages are really nice that i can use fountain pens and write with forces and the ink won't go to the other side. The only explains i got beside the price is that there are five bundles of papers and it makes it a bit hard to write due to the height of it above your desk. But anyway, the thickness is one charm of it, so you just need to deal with it.",0991557530,0.9462

"This is the best planner I've ever used - several of us in our office have ""drunk the Kool Aid"" and are passionate about our planners. It has really helped me get through items on my to do list that I always put off - when you have to constantly write them down it really does motivate you to just take care of that stupid task! I'm going to add a self adhesive 3M pocket to the inside cover of my next one to keep little notes in, and I use flags to bookmark certain pages for reference (adding a couple ""notes"" pages in the very back or front would be helpful for ideas that need time to marinate (sometimes until the next planner)). I don't know what the cover is made from, but it feels sooooo good in your hands, if that doesn't sound weird? It makes you want to carry it around and open it up and tell it all your aspirations...",0991846222,0.9146
"This planner is useful for those wishing to boost their productivity. The most difficult part is sticking to using the planner itself. I'm not big on inspirational quotes though, and the planner is full of them. I could use the wasted space for notes, lists, etc. And indeed, I sometime use white-out to cover the quotes and use the space anyway. Another issue is that it only has five days per week. This works well most people I assume because a lot of these planners use this type of method, but it frustrates me to no end. As a student with a full-time job, I need to be productive seven days a week!",0991846222,-0.7899
Great planner option for someone with a busy lifestyle and finds themselves unable to compelete all designated tasks throughout the week. The planner is a hard cover book (which is good for durability) and has pages filled with questionaires and different sections to help better completing your tasks for the day or week. Even if you are a well organized person who can get through their rough days it doesn't hurt to have a documentation of your hard work.

"I love these ""adult"" coloring books. I've always loved coloring, even with my kids when they were young and now with my grandkids. These adult coloring books have so much detail and depth to them. The pictures in this particular book are mostly animals. Coloring is very relaxing to me. And with these detailed pictures, it really takes your mind off of the problems even for a bit. You are never too old to color!",099337980X,0.8803
"My first impression of this coloring book was what a nice heavy duty quality the cover is and the size of the book, in dimensions. I was very excited to try this book out, I have used others in the past and still haven't found the coloring book I just LOVE. I used two different types of markers on the first title page to see if they would bleed through. They bled through. So I need to purchase some colored pencils and try this book again. Otherwise, it is a nice book. The coloring pages are beautiful, there is a nice variety of pictures and they are good size. If anyone can recommend some good colored pencils to use for this, I am searching amazon now.",099337980X,0.9831
"This is a really nice adult coloring book. The drawings have enough detail to make me happy, but the lines are thick enough so I don't go crazy. I color with Copic markers so I always want a book with thick paper and bold graphics. This works well. However, the images are printed on both sides of the page and the markers do bleed through. With coloring pencils you should have no problems. I also do not really care for the activity pages such as ""complete the maze"", ""seek and find these objects"" and ""draw a hat on this creature"". That's not what I color for. There are a few pages like that in the book, but still enough strictly coloring pages to keep me occupied.",099337980X,0.7504
"usually ""adult coloring book"" makes me think of a coloring book full of pornography that I get to color! which I would also buy in a minute.
This coloring book? wow, could it not have been more perfectly made for me! I am obsessed with owls, rabbits, birds, nature and these illustrations are amazing, beautiful, stunning, difficult! I cannot wait to use all my pens, gel..watercolor, pencils, etc in this.

The book is filled with printed pages of wildlife scenes, and has a few pages of ""draw your own"", which I have never seen before.

"The is a great adult coloring book for animal lovers. The images are pretty, varied, and lend themselves to colorful renditions. The Colorsoft Pencils work just great - ideal for shading. If you like them, you might want to purchase additional colors. (I also have had good luck with using watercolor pencils - a little water on a brush and you have great blending.) My main criteria for adult coloring images is that the drawings aren't ""sketched"" but that each item has complete boarders; this coloring book meets that specification.",099337980X,0.9432
"Quality color pencils AND a nice adult coloring book for under $10? Can't beat that. Colors are bright and vivid and the book has at least a couple hours of coloring time in there.

"This is an awesome coloring book. It's thicker than I expected, and the illustrations are intricate yet somehow rhythmic, if that makes sense. They're perfect for winding down or de-stressing.

"Love this coloring book and the pencils provided. I own just about any collection of colored pencils, from Faber Castell, to Carandache and Inktense to Luminance. After trying the Derwent colored pencils I am hooked again to buy the full set of these as well. They lay so nicely in my hand and there is something special about them. Every good quality pencil has a different feel and slightly different color/hue imo. The coloring book has a southwestern feel about it and the equity of the paper is superb. It comes with some fine introduction into layering, blending etc.which is useful for new colorists. A very nice book to get you started in the coloring book craze; to see if it might be a new hobby for you. Highly recommended!!!",099337980X,0.985
Too detailed and surface area to really color effectively.,099337980X,0.4902
"I have a few of these books. This one is my favorite. The pictures are beautiful and interesting, not too big or too small. Colored pencils would probably be ideal but I like using gel pens. I will probably go through my ink pretty quickly however. On a side note, the paper is thick enough that I can use gel ink and it doesnt ruin the pictures on the other side. I do find that these help my stress. I have a condition that aggravates my heart when Im stressed that is very noticeable. But if I take time to color in these I've noticed my symptoms have gone and I feel much more calm. And its way easier than meditating!",099337980X,0.9609
"I've not done adult coloring books before but several on my friends do and it looks relaxing. I love animals and thought this would be a cool choice. There are a variety of animals. I think the deer were some of the coolest but I liked the birds too. The book has a nice intro with tips on achieving different looks in the way your color the pictures included.
There are many different areas to color and each page takes a long time to complete if you want to create a cool pattern.
This book will provide many many hours of coloring and provides a nice selection of scenes to engage you in a relaxing hobby.",099337980X,0.9922
"I don't like this as well as I thought I would. The illustrations have a lot of bolder black lines that, to me, take away from the intricate detail of coloring. It's printed on both sides of the paper. Though the paper is fairly thick (and accepts watercolor pencils), there's still bleed-through with markers and some pens. It's not a bad coloring book, certainly not the worst I've seen, but not quite what I was hoping for.",099337980X,0.8863
"I have never lost my love to color, but am not artistic enough to draw or paint. This is a grown-up way to enjoy that pastime and feel like you are doing something pretty. I only dinged it a star for the price, as you can find different kinds of coloring books at Michael's for about $10. The paper is good quality and the designs on opposite sides of the paper are compatible and different at the same time. I'm learning how to shade, which I never did much of as a kid, and there are several youtube videos to help you do this better.",099337980X,0.9753

She immediately opened them to smell with me, but I found it hard to distinguish more than just a sweet scent from some of them. She assures me that each smell is unique though. They do write well and the glitter is definitely easy to see. I think after a month of coloring though the are starting to be used up. For the price, I think you could probably find a nicer set if you were willing to sacrifice the whole smell thing.",1223064417,0.9731
I have seen these pens motivate so many children to WRITE!!!! Why? They smell and the ink is bright and glittery. These pens are definitely motivators for kids to write more. Great for journaling or coloring or note taking. Great pen,1223064417,0.9593
"Pretty colors and they smell fine, but they don't write too well. There's limited fluidity in the ink and that frustrates young children. It frustrated me.",1223064417,-0.889

"Really cool and bright colors. Mix of pink, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple with one of each, plus some had 2 of that color. It states in the description that they smell, but mine don't have an odor. Some colors are hard to see. Need to give it awhile to dry so it doesn't smear.",1223064425,0.653
"I like the pen and the ease of coloring with them, but the fragrance does not last long and some of the colors fade, making red look like frosted pink.",1223064425,0.6956
"I loved these pens. I would definitely order them again. They are bright, glittery, and fun. The smells are light, so not too overpowering and disgusting smelling. Plus I love how many colors there are. You definitely get a bang for your buck with these!",1223064417,0.9485

"Great product, thanks.",1223064417,0.7906
My only issue is these pens Don't color in a rainbow blend of colors. I tried to get the pens to blend the colors but only two worked as stated in discription of them.. The pastel color is soft looking.,1223064425,0.0
"My 9 year old loves these pens. The ink is both smelly and sparkly - the best of both worlds for a little girl. The smell carries through to the paper and lasts a while. So far, they seem to be of good quality.",1223064417,0.8957
two granddaughters love pens looked interesting as a stocking stuffer for christmas,1223064425,0.7845
"The ink skipped too much for it to be usable. I tried every pen in the pack to check if it was just 1 dud pen. Unfortunately not, so I ended up returning it. I don't recall the pens having distinguishable smells. They smelled pleasant to me in general though.",1223064425,-0.0258
Ordered for a coworker's kids. He said they liked them.,1223064417,0.4215
These are great glitter markers. Flows so easy and the colors are beautifully. I've been using them for a while and hope to save you money by standing up for these great markers.,1223064417,0.971
Good job,1223064425,0.4404
"I was expecting a pen that would write better and more consistently, but unfortunately they write muddy lines that tend to skip or stop writing altogether. The colors are also more faint than I expected. They are made cheap and leave ink all over the tip of the pen. For the price, I wouldn't recommend them. They seem more like a novelty that would be at a dollar store.",1223064425,-0.5605
Not what was expected,1223064417,0.0
Got these for my daughters and nieces for Easter. They all loved them. It's cute how the ink changes color after a while and the smell is nice too. This is such a cute idea for girls and great gift ideas!!,1223064425,0.9652
"I ordered this pack of pens because i was looking for swirly/marble ink pens. This wasn't exactly what i was looking for (i wanted ink that wrote in changing colors) but i still liked this purchase-- the pens flowed okay, there was skipping here and there but the colors were vibrant and pretty. And the scent was there but it wasn't overwhelming.",1223064425,0.9428
I was so excited to get these but they don't write that well and they don't smell hardly at all! I still use them in hopes that they will write better and maybe using them more they may smell more!!,1223064425,0.8423
Nice,1223064417,0.4215

They don't have a scent and the ink didn't come out very well.,1223064425,0.3384
So disappointed with the way the ink does not blend,1223064425,-0.5256
I bought these at a book store and they were recommended by the sales person. I really enjoy these gel pens but wish the scent was stronger. I have a hard time picking it up but I like the way the gel pens write and color. I could have just gotten a bad box or maybe they were sitting on the shelf too long. The one that really stands out is the watermelon one and it smells great!,1223064417,0.9251
"Fun to use... Colored in a pattern using all of these pens, but then started using up the ink, and was unable to continue with the color I wanted to use... Won't use these again for coloring, but like them for writing...",1223064425,0.6597
"Flows easily but gloppy, resulting in too much product. Colors are soft, bordering on dull, which was a surprise because at first I thought they were almost neon.",1223064425,-0.0516
my 9 year old daughter loves these. She even wrote me a thank you poem.,1223064425,0.7351
